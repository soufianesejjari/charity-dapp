        <h1>What is Charity?</h1>
        <p>Charity is the act of giving help to those in need of it. It is a humanitarian act that involves providing resources, such as money, goods, or time, to those who are less fortunate.</p>
        <p>Our Charity DApp aims to bring transparency and efficiency to the process of donating and managing charitable funds. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that all transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable.</p>
